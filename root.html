                  <p>This video displays gameplay from the cute and cozy Root Odyssey game.<p>
					      	</p>The player starts with a handful of money and will have access to the farm shop, which allows them to purchase not just various vegtables but farm plot upgrades as well.
						      The player can use the number keys to navigate the hotbar and switch between which vegtable they wish to plant. There is an inventory system which can be used in case of a large
						      stockpile of vegtables.

						      <p>Once the vegtables have been planted the player will have to wait until their growth cycle has completed after which the vegtables will pop out from the ground
						      and once collected will instantly reward the player with money.</p>
						      <p>This was designed and created with 5 others in a very short 2 day game jam.</p>
