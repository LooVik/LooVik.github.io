      						<p>This video displays the short PSX style horror game.<p>
      						<p>The player must traverese the abandoned buildings to locate 3 sheets of paper that reveal the combination lock, which is required for the player to use on the lock at the end gate.
      						The monster roaming around will try to kill the player and works based on sight detection. The player can stun the monster by utilising their phone ability, which when triggered will cause
      						the monster to be stunned for 3 seconds allowing the player to escape their sight.</p>
      						<p>This was designed and created with 5 others during a 4 week game jam.</p>
